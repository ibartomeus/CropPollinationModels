    "text": "Our analysis uses the CropPol database (Allen-Perkins et al. 2022) as is basis. CropPol is an open and dynamic (i.e., periodically updated) database of crop pollination studies that currently contains the data from 137 studies of 49 different crop species from around the world (version 1.1.1). The majority of these datasets provided data on both insect visitation rates and crop yields or related measurements and were used in the analyses conducted for this paper. Within each study, the most basic unit of observation at which pollinator visit counts and the resulting yield can be paired was the site-year (\"site\" is typically a field or part of a field). Some sites were sampled for multiple years, but single-year sites were also common. In our analyses, we allowed multiple years of data to be part of the same study as long as the collection methods did not change. We only included studies with at least three site-years, resulting in a total of 93 studies of 35 crops. Because some studies included multiple years, this dataset represents a total of 128 study-years, and a total of 2305 site-years. As expected, studies from Europe and North America were somewhat overrepresented in our sample, together totaling almost two thirds of the datasets. It is also likely that even within regions there are biases in the landscapes where studies were located and in which crops were selected. This limits our ability to infer patterns on a global scale, but currently represents the best available data.\nA strength of the dynamic database is that it will allow continuous updates to our analysis as the number of available studies grows."

    "text": "Over 75% percent of the world's food crops are dependent on pollinators to at least some degree (IPBES 2017). In most crop systems, pollination is provided through a combination of managed honey bees and wild insects, which consist primarily of wild bees, but also flies and other insects (Larson et al. 2001, Rader et al. 2016). Despite not being managed for crop pollination, wild insects often make up a significant fraction of total flower visits and can even be the dominant pollinators in situations where agricultural intensity and/or land use is not extreme (Kremen et al. 2002, Ricketts et al. 2008, Garibaldi et al. 2011, Kennedy et al. 2013, Koh et al. 2016, Reilly et al. 2020)."

    "text": "Abstract\nOver 75% percent of the world’s food crops are dependent on pollinators to at least some degree (IPBES 2017). However, the degree of pollinators contribution to crop yield is contested because there is a large variability in crop types, pollinator communities, agricultural practices and environmental contexts. Fortunately, since the first case studies reporting a positive effect of pollinators on crop yield, more and more data has accumulated. This allowed us to conduct synthesis summarizing what we know (e.g. Garibaldi et al 2013, Rader et al. 2016, Dainese et al 2019). However, as the question is data hungry and is still not settled, we aim to embrace this uncertainty and periodically report updates as our knowledge increases.
