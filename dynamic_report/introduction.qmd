Over 75% percent of the world\'s food crops are dependent on
pollinators to at least some degree (IPBES 2017). In most crop
systems, pollination is provided through a combination of managed
honey bees and wild insects, which consist primarily of wild bees,
but also flies and other insects (Larson et al. 2001, Rader et al.
2016). Despite not being managed for crop pollination, wild insects
often make up a significant fraction of total flower visits and can
even be the dominant pollinators in situations where agricultural
intensity and/or land use is not extreme (Kremen et al. 2002,
Ricketts et al. 2008, Garibaldi et al. 2011, Kennedy et al. 2013, Koh
et al. 2016, Reilly et al. 2020).
